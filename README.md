GitHub Hello World Repository Tutorial

Hello World,

You can call me Curtis.
I am a musician with over 20 years of experience, as well as a U.S. Army Veteran. 
I am new to coding so please excuse the random repos. 
Hopefully I will be coding more, so you might not have to worry about the newby apps,
but just in case you are reading this before seeing the repos: "You have been warned" :)
